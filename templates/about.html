            <p>Have you ever noticed just how inefficient bar code scanners can truly be? They certainly make me wait way longer than I should have to.</p>
            <p>Well, look no further! This image recognition model, powered by the one and only Teachable Machine, is the perfect solution. Simply put an item you want to purchase into the view of the camera, and viola, you'll see the price of the item as well as the inventory name.</p>
            <p>This model will work for any store that has 1000+ pictures of each of its products. All you have to do is reach out to the creator of this program to work out the details.</p>

            <p>My name is Moshe Ginsburg, and I am a junior at Crossroads School for the Arts and Sciences. This project
                was an assignment from my CAS Computer Science class.</p>
            <p>I learned a ton about Image Recognition from this project. One big takeaway was just how accurate AI
                Image Recognition has become (very). A second is the fact that truly anyone who spends a few hours
                coding can create an accurate and useful model.</p>
